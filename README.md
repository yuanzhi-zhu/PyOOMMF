# PyOOMMF
Run OOMMF with python(especially in jupyter)

#### run_oommf.ipynb

This file let you use cmd to run oommf within jupyter.

I add basically all the features of oommf cmd line to this file.

#### oommf_visualization_omf.ipynb

The .omf file is the OOMMF Vector Field (OVF) format file. This file let you visualize the outputed .omf file. It's just like mmdisp, but the real-time visualization is not feasible now. You can choose either to make .jpg format pictures or .gif picture as you like!

#### oommf_visualization_odt.ipynb (todo)

The .odt file is the Data Table (ODT) format file.
